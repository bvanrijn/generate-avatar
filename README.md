# GenerateAvatar

I originally wrote this program in [Clojure][]. I rewrote it from scratch last night,
and it is **46% faster** and has **22% fewer parentheses**.

## Install and run

1. Open the [Releases page](https://github.com/bvanrijn/generate-avatar/releases) and expand the Assets node for the latest release.
2. Download `GenerateAvatar-refs.tags.<version>.jar`
3. Run it: `java -jar GenerateAvatar-refs.tags.<version>.jar`
